# Visual Ping
## A very simple tool aiming to display 'ping' results on a web page
### Built with NodeJS and Socket.io (work in progress)

Initially designed to get a graphical representation of a 'ping -t www.google.com', might come in a handy if you want to know how your network connection is doing
