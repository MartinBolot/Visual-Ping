# Visual Ping

![example image](/public/images/example.jpg)
## A very simple tool aiming to display 'ping' results on a web page
### Built with NodeJS and Socket.io (work in progress)

Initially designed to get a graphical representation of a 'ping -t www.google.com', might come in a handy if you want to know how your network connection is doing

It is aimed to be launched on your local computer :  
`git clone https://github.com/MartinBolot/Visual-Ping.git`  
`npm start`  
Then http://localhost:3000/

**Windows only for now**
